//! A poor-man adaptative barrier.
//!
//! An adaptative barrier blocks all task `wait`ing  at it,
//! unless all of its non-yet dropped clones have also had their `wait` method
//! called.
//!
//! It is "adaptive" because the number of synchronizing task does not have to
//! be known in advance.
//!
